<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/814/1*ORu3CvzLAnBskXcFMxq8uw.png" alt=""></figure><p>I started working at <a href="http://ahrefs.com">Ahrefs</a> one year ago. When I applied I had heard of them from <a href="http://discuss.ocaml.org">OCaml’s discuss</a> amongst other OCaml community spaces and I had met <a href="https://www.javierchavarri.com/">Javi</a> at an OCaml event. But I didn’t know much about the company or what it was like to work&nbsp;there.</p><p>It’s been a year so now’s a good time to look back: what’s it like to work at&nbsp;Ahrefs.</p><p>My first surprise was the infrastructure and especially the part of it dedicated to developers and developer experience. It’s nice to have a set of tools ready to go from day one. A small example: you push your development branch and the CI gives you a link to make a request to a spin-up-on-demand server with your changes on it. One click and you can see your changes! Another: the CI is never broken for long because it’s under constant supervision of bots who notify any failures to the relevant developers as well as some dedicated slack channels.</p><p>There’s no magic here: there’s just work from several people at the company to make this work. I’m one of those people contributing to the tools&nbsp;now.</p><p>Another surprise was how well remote work just works. Whilst there is a central office in Singapore, employees of Ahrefs live in many different countries. The team I’m part of is spread over five different timezones. And yet, it&nbsp;works.</p><p>Once again, there’s no magic: tools and processes are set up for it. At Ahrefs (there are likely other ways to make it work) the main ingredients relate to communications: meetings are few, communication is asynchronous by default and public as much as possible. Taken together these ingredients improve knowledge sharing and discoverability which benefits everyone.</p><p>It is daunting to ask very beginner questions to a public channel. But it turns out that a lot of your questions have already been answered and you can find them with a simple search. And asking the few other questions you have in public channels is just contributing to this searchable corpus of questions.</p><p>The biggest surprise for me was really about responsibility, agency, and trust. In a nutshell: if something needs doing (a bug needs fixing, a feature needs improving), you do it. Of course there are cases where you are doing something else more urgent, or someone else might be able to do it better, or it might be too much for a single person to do, or it might affect other developer’s workflow, or it might change customers’ experience, or some other exception. In these cases you discuss the ideas with colleagues. But as a general rule, if you noticed that something needs doing, then you are likely the person most able to do it. So you do&nbsp;it.</p><p>When I was trying to explain this to friends asking me how the new job was going, I struggled to articulate it very well. So I’ll try here: Instead of project proposals and preliminary meetings and many other management guard rails, Ahrefs gives its developers enough agency and extends them enough trust to&nbsp;work.</p><p>All and all, work at Ahrefs starts at the deep end: you are asked to be autonomous relatively quickly. But past the initial hurdles, there is a nice experience with some custom tooling, some efficient communication practices, and a healthy level of trust in everyone’s abilities.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=065167c61542" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com/one-year-at-ahrefs-065167c61542">One year at Ahrefs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com">Ahrefs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2025/about">Advent of Code</a> has long been a favorite December
ritual at Jane Street, with many participating in the month-long puzzle challenge that
encourages thoughtful engineering and out-of-the-box thinking – very much our kind of fun.
Last year, Anish, a hardware engineer at Jane Street, wrote about tackling the entire
series in Hardcaml, our OCaml-based hardware DSL, turning these puzzles into synthesizable
FPGA circuits. If you missed it, his post, <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-hardcaml-2024/">Advent of
Hardcaml</a>, walks you through how implementing such algorithms
in hardware became a unique exercise in architectural design and resource optimization.</p>

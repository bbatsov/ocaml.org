<p>Gave Haskell Symposium 2014 Keynote on functional OS design, somewhat nervously talking to a room full of Haskellers about OCaml modules. The keynote explored how functional programming principles could be applied to operating systems design, using MirageOS as a concrete example. I discussed the benefits of OCaml's module system for building composable OS components and how type-driven development could improve systems security and reliability.</p>

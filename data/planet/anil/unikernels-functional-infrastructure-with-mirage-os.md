<p>Talk at Esper on functional programming with unikernels to a packed room at their OCaml meetup in California. I covered how MirageOS enables building functional infrastructure by compiling OCaml applications directly into specialized unikernels. The talk demonstrated the integration possibilities with Docker and explored how Irmin's distributed storage capabilities could revolutionize how we build cloud services.</p>

<p>At HotCloud for the first talk about MirageOS, presenting our vision for software specialization in the cloud. This was the first public outing of the MirageOS concept at USENIX HotCloud 2010 in Boston. The paper proposed running applications directly on cloud hardware without traditional OS layers, using OCaml to generate specialized binaries that execute as Xen guest operating systems. Our early prototype showed significant performance improvements for I/O and memory handling compared to the same code running under Linux/Xen.</p>

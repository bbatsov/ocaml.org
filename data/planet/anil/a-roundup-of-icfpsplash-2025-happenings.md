<p>I had an amazingly fun week at
<a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025">ICFP/SPLASH</a> in Singapore;
it was the first time that these two major programming languages conferences
were held simultaneously. My submissions turned into a bit of a <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/profile/icfp-splash-2025/anilmadhavapeddy">success
disaster</a>;
I ended up chairing a workshop, giving several talks and a keynote, and
organising a tutorial, and helping out a bunch of colleague and students.  And
if this wasn't enough to fill up the week, collaborators I hadn't seen in a few
years were also presenting a tonne of interesting work, so there was no time to
breathe!</p>
<p>So much went on that I've split up the post into a five parter:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Part 1:</em> <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/icfp25-propl">Chairing the 2nd Programming for the Planet Workshop</a></li>
<li><em>Part 2:</em> <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/icfp25-oxcaml">Holding a tutorial on OxCaml</a></li>
<li><em>Part 3:</em> <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/icfp25-ocaml5-js-docker">Migrations to OCaml 5 with Jane Street and Docker</a></li>
<li><em>Part 4:</em> <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/icfp25-post-posix">My case for post-POSIX IO being important for runtime designers</a></li>
<li><em>Part 5:</em> <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/icfp25-what-i-learnt">What I learnt from other people's talks and chats</a></li>
</ul>

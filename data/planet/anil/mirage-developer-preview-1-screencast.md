<p>Mirage Developer Preview 1 screencast, showing developers how to get started with MirageOS. The screencast walked through initializing and building both Unix and Xen kernels from the same OCaml codebase. This was an important milestone in making MirageOS accessible to developers, demonstrating the workflow for creating unikernels and the power of portable functional code that could target multiple backends.</p>

<p>I'm somewhat frazzled after managing to get through <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025">25 days of agentic coding</a>.  It hasn't actually been that much physical work, but I
underestimated just how much my brain would be in full gear multitasking across
<em>so many</em> terminal windows and ideas.  My outbound queue that I didn't manage to write
up is enormous: I have sessions running with OxCaml experiments, io_uring webservers, implementations of ATProto, a pure OCaml Parquet, and some even stranger ideas I won't go into now!</p>
<p>In the past, my computer systems brain was limited by the speed of coding, but now it feels like we're entering a different age. I'll reserve my longform thoughts on all of this for the new year as I need to head into Christmas festivities, but I wanted to leave you all with my <strong><a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-claude-marketplace">Claude Code OCaml marketplace</a></strong> in case you want to try this stuff for yourself!</p>

<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#claude-skills-and-marketplaces" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Claude Skills and marketplaces</h2>
<p>Claude has made it very simple to distribute <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces">plugins</a>. I just created a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-claude-marketplace">avsm/ocaml-claude-marketplace</a> and kicked off Claude's own development plugin to develop plugins with. I then fed it all my skills and asked it to generalise them a bit.  They'll likely need some work to generalise beyond me, but feel free to send in PRs!</p>

<p>I'll be back in the new year with more thoughts, but in the meanwhile, I hope
you all have a very good holiday and a chance to recharge! It's going to be a
mad 2026...</p>

<p>My PhD thesis is now also published as a print book, making the work on type-safe network application development more accessible. The thesis demonstrated how functional programming languages with strong type systems could be used to build network protocols and applications with correctness guarantees. These ideas about using types for security and verification continue to influence my work on systems programming with OCaml.</p>

<p>Appeared on FLOSS Weekly 302 about Open Mirage, where Randal Schwartz and Simon Phipps interviewed me about the MirageOS project. We discussed how unikernels bring functional programming principles to systems programming, the benefits of using OCaml for building secure network services, and the open source community growing around the project. It was a great opportunity to introduce MirageOS to a broader open source audience.</p>

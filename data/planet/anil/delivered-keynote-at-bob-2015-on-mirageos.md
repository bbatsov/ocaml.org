<p>I hopped over to Berlin to give the keynote at <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2015/en/">BOB 2015</a> on functional operating systems. The talk focused on how we can apply functional programming principles to build unikernels with MirageOS, compiling OCaml applications directly into specialized virtual machine images that run on the Xen hypervisor. This represents a radical rethinking of the traditional OS stack, eliminating much of the bloat and attack surface of conventional operating systems. If you're in the region, I <em>highly</em> recommend attending BOB as a superbly organised conference with a diverse and interesting crowd of functional programmers.</p>

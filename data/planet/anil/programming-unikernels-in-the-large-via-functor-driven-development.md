<p>Preprint on programming unikernels with ML modules, exploring functor-driven development with Gabriel Radanne, Thomas Gazagnaire, Jeremy Yallop, Richard Mortier and others. The paper tackled the configuration matrix problem - realistic unikernel applications depend on hundreds of libraries, each with different requirements across heterogeneous platforms. We showed how OCaml's module system, particularly functors, could cleanly separate configuration from application logic, enabling modular composition and leveraging link-time optimization for efficiency.</p>

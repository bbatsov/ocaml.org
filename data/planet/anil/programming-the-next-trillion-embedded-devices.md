<p>Part 3 of my distinguished lecture series at St Andrews on functional foundations for operating systems. This talk explores the programming challenges we'll face with the coming wave of embedded devices - likely trillions of them over the next decade. The series at St Andrews was a great opportunity to present a comprehensive vision for how functional programming approaches, particularly OCaml and unikernels, can address the unique constraints of embedded systems. These devices need to be secure, resource-efficient, and easy to deploy at scale, which makes traditional OS approaches challenging.</p>
